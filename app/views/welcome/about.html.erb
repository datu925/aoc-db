<p>Whitewashing roles, or casting white actors in roles intended for actors of color (AOC), is a harmful and unfortunately common practice in theater. We hope that in the vast majority of cases, the reason is simply that casting directors do not feel they have access to a sufficiently large pool of talented actors of color.</p>

<p>To help combat this problem in Chicago theater, Monty Cole, Bear Bellinger, and Emjoy Gavino began collecting contact information for minority actors in 2016 so that they could open it up to casting directors and theaters looking for minority talent. This database represents the fruits of that labor. Chicago-area actors can create profiles indicating what ages, races, and ethnicities they are comfortable playing, any kind of work or specific skillsets they have, and resume/headshots.</p>

<p>We want this to be a safe space for AOC, and we take privacy very seriously - profiles and contact information are only shared with moderator-approved theater accounts (this site is not intended to be an actor social-networking site). Additionally, those accounts can only make a limited number of specific searches. We will not be sending out the full database to anyone, nor can any user see the full range of ways another user identifies, so you can feel free to self-identify as you see fit without fear of judgment.</p>

<p>This site is free for all, and is always intended to be! With any questions, please reach out to <a href='mailto:chicagoaoc@gmail.com'>chicagoaoc@gmail.com</a>.</p>
